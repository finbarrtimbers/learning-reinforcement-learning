# Credits

Most of what I've written here is either a direct copy of, or heavily inspired
by, code written by others online. I have tried to give as much credit as
possible below; if I'm missing anything, please let me know by sending me an email at
`finbarrtimbers` at Google's email service.

- [`kvfrans`](https://github.com/kvfrans) excellent CartPole
  [tutorial](http://kvfrans.com/simple-algoritms-for-solving-cartpole/) inspired
  most of the code that I wrote to solve CartPole.
- [Rich Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/index.html) and
  [Andrew Barto](http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/~barto/)'s book provides most of
  inspiration for doing the project.
